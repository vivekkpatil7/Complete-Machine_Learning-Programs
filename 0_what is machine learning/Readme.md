<h1> what is machine learning ? </h1>

<b>Machine Learning</b> is an Application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) it gives devices the ability to learn from their experiences and improve their self without doing any coding. For Example, when you shop from any website it’s shows related search like:- People who bought also saw this.

### Case -

we have some data and then perfom some algorithm. we told algorithum to explore data (input data(x)) and find patterns between data , once we find pettern then we again give input then machine learning application give data as output (output data(y)).

at begging we give data to machine as input and output to the machine and then give program as a output.(prediction, recommandation)

### when we use machine learning ?

1. **Email spam classifier**

we can’t write a code for every case of email. in machine learing we find pattern in data and then decide to make deccison, lets suppose some people report as spam then machine learning algorithum finds okay its is spam. its was always different but machine learning able to handle every can deu to this learning and use it on all cases.

1. **For example image classifier**
2. **Data mining**

**Finding hidden pattern in data**

**Why is the machine learning trend emerging so fast in the 21st century?AnswerFollow·**2**Request**

Mainly there are 3 reasons:

1. Increase of processing power that allows fast training of ML Models, for a couple of years we hold in our pockets smartphones which pretty much surpass supercomputers from 20–30 years ago in terms of processing power
2. Decrease of storage costs that allow us to store very cheaply data that could be used later to train ML models
3. Research in this AI/ML field has surged in recent years, just watch on inovations from the top research commpanies like OpenAI or DeepMind

To conclude this three factors are also being catalists for each other so the growth rate is faster and faster.

### **Formal Defination**

“**Field of study that gives computers the capability to learn without being explicitly programmed”.**

### Why machine learning ?

With the help of Machine Learning, businesses can automate routine tasks. It also helps in automating and quickly create models for data analysis. Various industries depend on vast quantities of data to optimize their operations and make intelligent decisions. Machine Learning helps in creating models that can process and analyze large amounts of complex data to deliver accurate results. These models are precise and scalable and function with less turnaround time. By building such precise Machine Learning models, businesses can leverage profitable opportunities and avoid unknown risks.

**What is machine learning used for?**

Machine Learning is used in our daily lives much more than we know it. These are areas where machine learning is used:

- Facial Recognition
- Self-driving cars
- Virtual assistants
- Traffic Predictions
- Speech Recognition
- Online Fraud Detection
- Email Spam Filtering
- Product Recommendations

**What are the types of Machine Learning?**

The broad types of machine learning are:

- Supervised Machine Learning
- Unsupervised Machine Learning
- Semi-supervised Learning
- Reinforcement Learning

**Why is machine learning popular?**

The amount of data available to us is constantly increasing. Machines make use of this data to learn and improve the results and outcomes provided to us. These outcomes can be extremely helpful in providing valuable insights and taking informed business decisions as well. Machine Learning is constantly growing, and with that, the applications of machine learning are growing as well. We make use of machine learning in our day-to-day life more than we know it. In the future, machine learning is only said to grow further and help us. Thus, it is popular.

### What type of data machine learning need ?

**numerical data(continuous - discrete), categorical data(ordinal data(rank something)-nominal(gender,name,country) ()), time series data(egular intervals over some period of time), and text data**.

Almost anything can be turned into DATA. Building a deep understanding of the different data types is a crucial prerequisite for doing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering for Machine Learning models.

### **Some Terminology of Machine Learning**

- **Model**: Also known as “hypothesis”, a machine learning model is the mathematical representation of a real-world process. A machine learning algorithm along with the training data builds a machine learning model.
- **Feature**: A feature is a measurable property or parameter of the data-set.
- **Feature Vector**: It is a set of multiple numeric features. We use it as an input to the machine learning model for training and prediction purposes.
- **Training**: An algorithm takes a set of data known as “training data” as input. The learning algorithm finds patterns in the input data and trains the model for expected results (target). The output of the training process is the machine learning model.
- **Prediction**: Once the machine learning model is ready, it can be fed with input data to provide a predicted output.
- **Target (Label)**: The value that the machine learning model has to predict is called the target or label.
- **Overfitting**: When a massive amount of data trains a machine learning model, it tends to learn from the noise and inaccurate data entries. Here the model fails to characterise the data correctly.

     Model is total realie on training data not accepting any new data and make different pattern.

- **Underfitting**: It is the scenario when the model fails to decipher the underlying trend in the input data. It destroys the accuracy of the machine learning model. In simple terms, the model or the algorithm does not fit the data well enough.

     If your model give 100% accuracy there is some mistake in data.
