In machine learning we have specify features but in deep learning we dont did to specify features. But in deep learning machine capibal to detect patterns in data. 

# **What is AI?**

**AI (Artificial intelligence)**Â is a branch of computer science in which machines are programmed and given a cognitive ability to think and mimic actions like humans and animals. The benchmark for AI is human intelligence regarding reasoning, speech, learning, vision, and problem solving, which is far off in the future.

### **AI has three different levels**

**1) Narrow AI**: A artificial intelligence is said to be narrow when the machine can perform a specific task better than a human. The current research of AI is here now

**2) General AI**: An artificial intelligence reaches the general state when it can perform any intellectual task with the same accuracy level as a human would

**3) Active AI**: An AI is active when it can beat humans in many tasks

**What is ML?**

# **What is Deep Learning?**

Deep learning is a computer software that mimics the network of neurons in a brain. It is a subset of machine learning and is called deep learning because it makes use of deep neural networks. The machine uses different layers to learn from the data. The depth of the model is represented by the number of layers in the model. Deep learning is the new state of the art in term of AI. In deep learning, the learning phase is done through a neural network. A neural network is an architecture where the layers are stacked on top of each other
